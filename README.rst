    *I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the
    shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark, near the
    Tannh√§user Gate. All those moments will be lost, in time, like tears in
    rain. Time to die.*

Hacking
-------

To populate a virtualenv, run tests, etc, see the commands in the Makefile.
These can often work in Windows too, under Bash shells like Cygwin, Msys.

Populating the virtualenv in the manner shown in the Makefile will also
add "-e ." to the virtualenv, which adds this project in 'develop mode',
meaning both that source edits are immediately visible within the virtualenv,
and that the application entry points listed in setup.py are converted into
executable scripts on the PATH.
