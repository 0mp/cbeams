cbeams v{version}

    I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.
    Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.
    I watched c-beams glitter in the dark, near the Tannh√§user Gate.
    All those moments will be lost, in time, like tears in rain.
    Time to die.

Usage:
    cbeams [options]
    --help    -h   Show this text.
    --version -v   Print version number and exit.
