cbeams
======

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the
shoulder of Orion. I watched c-beams glitter in the dark, near the TannhÃ¤user
Gate. All those moments will be lost, in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.

Dependencies
------------

Python >= 3.5.
A terminal or terminal emulator.

Install
-------

::

    pip install cbeams

Hacking
-------

To populate a virtualenv, run tests, etc, see the commands in the Makefile.
These can often work in Windows too, under Bash shells like Cygwin, Msys.

Populating the virtualenv in the manner shown in the Makefile will also
add "-e ." to the virtualenv, which adds this project in 'develop mode',
meaning both that source edits are immediately visible within the virtualenv,
and that the application entry points listed in setup.py are converted into
executable scripts on the PATH.

Thanks
------

To the processes or influences that resulted in the creation of our universe
and the emergence within it of complexity, life, and intelligence.
